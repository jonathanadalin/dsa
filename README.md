This repo contains my notes from studying 
[DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.academia.edu/30843807/DSA_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Annotated_Reference_with_Examples). 
I have gone through this reading a couple of times now without keeping formal 
notes. I thought to start this repo to gather my thoughts and learnings to 
hopefully help future me, or anyone really that might find them useful.
